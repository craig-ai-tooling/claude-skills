# Ralph loop — run Claude Code headless, ONE task per iteration, fresh context.
#
# The whole point is a fresh context every iteration. Long-running sessions drift,
# forget the plan, and start inventing. Each iteration re-reads the plan from disk,
# does exactly one task, commits, and exits. State lives in git and in
# ralph/PROGRESS.md — never in a conversation.
#
# Usage:
#   ./ralph/loop.sh              # up to 20 iterations
#   ./ralph/loop.sh 5            # up to 5
#   DRY_RUN=1 ./ralph/loop.sh 1  # print the command, run nothing
#
# Stops when: the cap is hit, the plan reports complete, or an iteration fails.
